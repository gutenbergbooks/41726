<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I. Narcissus.</span>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xi" title="xi"> </a></h3>

<p class="noi"> <img src="images/initial002.jpg" width="100" height="103" alt="T"
title="T" class="floatl" />HIS play, which for want of a ready-made
title I have called <em>Narcissus</em>, dates from a period of peculiar interest
in the history of that class of dramatic composition to which it
belongs.</p>

<p>So vast a phenomenon as the rise and fall of the complete English drama
could not but be attended by widely-spread symptoms of the popular love
for stage representation; a tendency which, though it would never have
produced a Shaksperian tragedy, yet alone rendered possible the work of
a Shakspere. These lesser manifestations of the feeling that pervaded
Elizabethan England may be compared to the small fissures on the side of
a volcano, through which the same lava as fills the molten crater
emanates in slender and perhaps hardly perceptible channels. It may
chance that the activity of these side-streams presages the final
eruption at the summit; yet afterwards they are scarcely noticed, and
their effects are too puny to attract attention. So it is with the
abortive forms of drama, heralding, accompanying, and in some cases
outliving, the culmination of English dramatic art under Shakspere. They
are not, as a rule, the product of those great intellects which helped
in the rearing of the main structure; but rather of such lesser writers
as were either possessed <a class="pagenum" name="Page_xii" title="xii"> </a>by the dramatic spirit while ignorant of the
formative and restraining rules of art, or else imbued with a desire to
follow those rules, as they had been drawn up by Aristotle and Horace
and exemplified in French and Italian literature, whilst themselves
wanting in originality, and oblivious of the superiority of a native
growth over the best of importations. The latter class of would-be
English dramatists, in especial, found a natural field for action
amongst the scholarly societies which constituted a mediæval university.
Though as early as 1584 and 1593 statutes are found enacting that no
players shall perform within five miles of Oxford, it must be remembered
that these refer to professional, not to academical actors, and that the
regulations controlling the former were of much greater stringency than
those which concerned the latter.</p>

<p>Nor were plays imitated from Greek and Latin
writers the only ones to be performed by undergraduates
and others before select audiences in the college halls.
Youthful players would probably demand the introduction
of something more or less witty; and the fact that
theatrical representations generally took place on the
occasion of a royal visit, or at times of special rejoicing,
accounts in some degree for the casting aside of the
strictly classical models, and the employment of masques,
or of such looser forms of comedy as were the outcome of
Heywood's <em>Interludes</em>, into either of which contemporary
allusions and jests could be readily introduced. Nevertheless,
the majority of such pieces continued to deal
with subjects taken from Roman and Greek mythology,
the various anachronisms and absurdities which arose
from this method of treatment only contributing to
heighten the amusement of the spectators.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xiii" title="xiii"> </a>

I have already implied that <cite>Narcissus</cite> belongs to the
class of University plays, inasmuch as it was acted at
S. John's College, Oxford, on Twelfth Night, 1602. It
does not, however, approximate in any way to the
classical form of comedy; it is rather to be regarded as a
Christmas piece, an imitation of the Yule-tide mummeries
acted by disguised villagers or townsfolk at the
houses of such wealthier persons as would afford them
hospitality.</p>

<p>The following list of Oxford plays&mdash;compiled, with
additions, from W. L. Courtney's article in <cite>Notes and
Queries</cite> for December 11th, 1886, and W. Carew Hazlitt's
<cite>Manual of English Plays</cite>&mdash;may be of interest, as showing
the frequency of dramatic entertainments at the
various colleges between 1547 and the Restoration. The
dates appended are in most cases those of presentation;
but when these are either unknown, or impossible to distinguish
from dates of entry at Stationers' Hall, I have
substituted the latter.</p>

<p>This catalogue does not, of course, pretend to be<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xvi" title="xvi"> </a>
exhaustive. An examination of the various college
archives would doubtless afford further material. There
exists, for instance, the record of performances at Merton;
cf. G. C. Brodrick's <cite>Memorials of Merton College</cite> (Oxford
Hist. Soc., 1885), p. 67: "In January and February,
1566-7, two dramatic performances were given in the
Warden's lodgings by members of the foundation ...
the one being an English comedy, and the other Terence's
<cite>Eunuchus</cite>.... Again, in 1568, a play of Plautus was
acted in the hall."</p>

<p>It will be seen that of the above-mentioned plays six,
besides <cite>Narcissus</cite>, were performed at the College of
S. John the Baptist, the first recorded being the <cite>Christmas
Prince</cite> in 1607, the succeeding ones taking place
after an interval of twenty-six years; and to these we
should very probably add <cite>Pharamus</cite>, the writer of which,
Thomas Snelling, "became Scholar of S. John's in 1633,
aged 19, and afterwards fellow ... and was esteemed
an excellent Latin poet." (Wood, <cite>Ath. Ox.</cite>, vol. iii.,
p. 275.)</p>

<p>A passage from Wake's <cite>Rex Platonicus</cite> (ed. 1, p. 18)
is also worthy of note in this connection:

<p>The <cite>Christmas Prince</cite> is, properly speaking, not a
single play, but a collection of performances consequent
on the revival of the old custom, left in abeyance since
1577, of choosing a prince, or master of the revels, who
should exercise undisputed authority during the festive
season, and in whose honour the company at large<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xviii" title="xviii"> </a>
should indulge freely in various sorts of pastimes. The
account given of this revival, in 1607, seems to imply
that there had been of late years no Christmas festivities
at S. John's. In 1602 the college porter, pleading for
the admission of players on Twelfth Night, could say:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Christmas is now at the point to bee past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis giving vp the ghost and this is the last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shall it passe thus without life or cheere?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hath not beene seene this many a yeere."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Without laying too much stress upon a single allusion,
it is safe to assert that the discovery of the comedy of
<cite>Narcissus</cite>, played five years earlier than the performances
of which an account is given in the <cite>Christmas Prince</cite>,
must be of considerable interest in the history of S.
John's, and indeed in that of Oxford play-acting
generally.</p>

<p>The MS. containing this comedy is one of the Rawlinson
collection, now in the possession of the Bodleian
Library. The volume, which is 5½ × 4 inches in size,
with 156 leaves, appears to have been the commonplace
book of an Oxford man. It contains a variety
of English poems and prose pieces, written at the end of
the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century;
amongst them several pages of extracts from the essays
of Bacon and of his less-known contemporary Robert
Johnson. Sir H. Wotton's poem, "How happy is he
borne or taught," also finds a place in the collection.
But the majority of the contents are of small literary value,
and, so far as I am aware, have never been published.
Perhaps the most interesting pieces in the volume are
certain "English Epigrammes much like Buckminster's
Almanacke ... calculated by John Davis of Grayes
Inne ... 1594" of the character of which the following<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xix" title="xix"> </a>
lines, occurring early in the series, may give some
idea.</p>

<p>That the play now under consideration is the work of
some member or members of the college of S. John's
there can be no doubt. It is, as the Prologue affirms,
"Ovid's owne Narcissus," <em>i.e.</em>, the story of Narcissus as
told in the third book of the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, which forms
the basis of the plot; and the resemblance to the Latin is
in parts so close as necessarily to imply a knowledge of
that language on the part of the writer. There is, indeed,
one passage of literal and yet graceful translation (see
ll. 494-505) which especially betokens a scholarly hand.</p>

<p>But it has been already hinted that the chief interest
of the comedy lies in another direction. The arrangement
and methods are those of the rough-and-ready<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xx" title="xx"> </a>
English stage of the period; and as in the Pyramus and
Thisbe interlude of the <cite>Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>, and
the Nine Worthies of <cite>Love's Labour's Lost</cite>, the writer
imitates and ridicules that naïve realism which appertained
to native comedy in its rude embryonic forms.
The absurdities with which the <cite>Narcissus</cite> abounds are
obviously intentional; it is, in fact, a burlesque, not skilful
nor humorous enough to take its place beside the
immortal parodies of Shakspere, which in aim and
scope it resembles, but a good average specimen of its
class, doubtless provocative of intense delight in the
minds of a contemporary audience. It is, of course, with
a view to heightening the reality of the effect that the
Porter is made to plead on behalf of certain "youths of
the parish," who are waiting, armed with their wassail-bowl,
for admittance into the hall, and who, besides a
song, have "some other sporte too out of dowbt" for the
delectation of the assembled guests. Then follows, first
the song, and afterwards an altercation in prose between
the Porter and the Players, who assume an air of bashfulness
when called upon to exercise their dramatic talent.
Finally, the Prologue enters, and the play is begun; the
general smoothness of the versification standing out in
contrast to the intentional doggerel of the Porter's introductory
speech and epilogue.</p>

<p>The mention of "youths of the parish" is probably not
serious; but as an allusion to a real play of the kind here
imitated, the following extract from the <cite>Christmas Prince</cite>
(ed. 1816, p. 25) may be of interest: "S. Steevens day
was past over in silence, and so had S. John's day also;
butt that some of the princes honest neighbours of
S. Giles presented him with a maske or morris, which
though it were but rudely performed, yet itt being so
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxi" title="xxi"> </a>freely &amp; lovingly profered it could not but bee as lovingly
received."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall now pass on to the consideration of the play
itself, and, first, of the characters which make up the list
of <em>dramatis personæ</em>. Five of these, namely, Tiresias,
Cephisus, Narcissus, Echo, and Liriope, appear in the
story of Narcissus as told by Ovid. Cephisus, son of
Pontus and Thalassa, and divinity of the river whence
he derives his name, is the father of the hero; the nymph
Liriope is his mother. Tiresias, the blind prophet of
Thebes, and Echo, the unhappy victim of the anger of
Juno and the contempt of Narcissus, are well-known
figures in classical mythology. Neither Dorastus and
Clinias, who attend Narcissus as youthful friends, nor
Florida and Clois, nymphs enamoured of his beauty, have
any actual counterparts in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>.</p>

<p>Most curious and interesting is the inclusion of "The
Well" in the list of characters. We have here no mere
stage property, or piece of scenery, but an actual personification
of an inanimate object, closely resembling that
of Wall and Moonshine in Peter Quince's company.
Just as Moonshine carries a lantern to represent more
vividly the actual moon, so the personage called The Well
aids the imagination of his audience by the visible sign
of a water-bucket. The fact of his being enumerated
amongst the <em>dramatis personæ</em> shows that the part was
played by a separate artist, and not doubled with that of
any other character. Of the Porter, Francis, more will be
said in Section II.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The play of <cite>Narcissus</cite>, though it can boast of no
artificial divisions, falls naturally into twelve different<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxii" title="xxii"> </a>
portions, which for want of a better term I will call
scenes. Whilst using this word it is necessary to bear
in mind that no change of <em>scenery</em> is implied, and probably
none was intended.</p>

<p><em>Scene I.</em> reveals Cephisus, Liriope, and Narcissus,
awaiting the prophet Tiresias. It consists of 132 lines,
amplified from <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 341, 346-348:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Prima fide vocisque ratæ tentamina sumsit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cærula Liriope ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... De quo consultus, an esset<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempora maturæ visurus longa senectæ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fatidicus vates&mdash;'Si se non viderit' inquit."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The introduction of Cephisus, the conversation between
Narcissus and his parents, the telling of the youth's
fate <em>by the aid of chiromancy</em>, and Liriope's scornful comment
on the prophecy, are the materials used by the
English writer to form an effective scene.</p>

<p><em>Scene II.</em> is wholly an interpolation. Dorastus and
Clinias also try their fate with Tiresias; he prophesies
their early death, and they jest upon the subject.</p>

<p><em>Scene III.</em>, in which Dorastus and Clinias flatter Narcissus
for his beauty, has no counterpart in Ovid. Probably,
however, it was suggested by <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 353-355:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Multi illum juvenes, multæ cupiere puellæ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sed fuit in tenera tam dira superbia forma;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nulli illum juvenes, nullæ tetigere puellæ."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Scene IV.</em> pursues a like theme; the nymphs Florida
and Clois are in their turn repulsed by the scornful youth,
and relate their woes to Dorastus and Clinias.</p>

<p>The hint for this is given in <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 402:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sic hanc, sic alias undis aut montibus ortas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Luserat hic Nymphas."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="noi"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxiii" title="xxiii"> </a>
And likewise the suggestion of Florida's revengeful
wish:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Inde manus aliquis despectus ad æthera tollens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sic amet ipse licet, sic non potiatur amato!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dixerat."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Scene V.</em> Echo enters, and gives an account of herself,
amplified&mdash;with a very free use of the English vernacular&mdash;from
<cite>Met.</cite> iii. 356-368.</p>

<p><em>Scene VI.</em>, which has no counterpart in Ovid, consists
of a spirited hunting-song in five stanzas, sung (presumably)
while Narcissus, Dorastus, and Clinias chase a
supposed hare over the stage.</p>

<p><em>Scene VII.</em> introduces the "one with a bucket," <em>i.e.</em>, The
Well. The first twelve lines of his speech are a literal
and smoothly-versified translation of <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 407-412.
In Ovid, however, this description of the well comes
after the conversation between Echo and Narcissus, and
the account proceeds at once (l. 413) with:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hic puer, et studio venandi lassus et æstu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Procubuit."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is doubtful why the English writer should have preferred
to introduce the Well thus early. With Ovid's
lines may be compared those in the translation of the
<cite>Romaunt of the Rose</cite> attributed to Chaucer:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;Springyng in a marble stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had nature set the sothe to tel<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For moyste so thycke and wel lykyng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it ne may in wynter dye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more than may the see be drye.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0 center">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxiv" title="xxiv"> </a><span class="i0">In worlde is none so clere of hewe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water is euer fresshe and newe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That welmeth vp with wawes bright."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Scene VIII.</em> consists of a dialogue between Dorastus
and Echo.</p>

<p><em>Scene IX.</em> continues the same theme, Clinias being
substituted for Dorastus. Both these scenes are interpolations,
introduced evidently for the amusement of the
audience rather than for any bearing on the main plot.</p>

<p><em>Scene X.</em> Here Narcissus delivers himself of a soliloquy,
suggested by <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 479:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Forte puer, comitum seductus et agmine fido,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dixerat"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">He is answered by Echo, who wishes to proffer him her
affection. The conversation, gathered from Ovid, runs
as follows:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ecquis adest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veni!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veni!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quid me fugis?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quid me fugis?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huc Coëamus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coeämus!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, with various amplifications, is followed in ll. 602-630
of the <cite>Narcissus</cite>.</p>

<p>Here, however, there is no reproduction of Ovid's
account:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et verbis favet ipsa suis, egressaque silvis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ibat, ut injiceret sperato brachia collo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ille fugit, fugiensque manus complexibus aufert."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">which leads on to and explains the next speech of Narcissus:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Ante' ait 'emoriar, quam sit tibi copia nostri.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">rendered in the English by:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxv" title="xxv"> </a>
<span class="i0">"Let mee dye first ere thou meddle with mee."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This terminates the interview; Echo does not seem to
make any appearance on the stage. The few lines which,
in Ovid, describe the effect of her hopeless love, are
partly followed in ll. 740-747 of the English play.</p>

<p><em>Scene XI.</em> Dorastus and Clinias abuse, fight with, and
finally kill each other.</p>

<p><em>Scene XII.</em> Narcissus enters, <em>fleeing from Echo</em> (a connecting
touch not found in Ovid). His speech, on discovering
the well, is a mixture of the description of his
transports in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, and of the soliloquy
there attributed to him. ll. 697-707 of the <cite>Narcissus</cite>
correspond word for word to <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 442-450.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the use of the name of the goddess
of corn instead of bread itself ("Cereris," l. 437) should
have suggested to the English writer a similar metaphorical
use of the names of Morpheus and Bacchus.
Another small point worthy of note is the introduction of
a jest into the midst of this mournful scene; Ovid's:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et, quantum motu formosi suspicor oris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Verba refers aures non pervenientia nostras"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">being irreverently rendered by:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And by thy lippes moving, well I doe suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woordes thou dost speake, may well come to our nose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to oure eares I am sure they never passe."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ovid's Narcissus discovers his own identity with the
vision (<cite>Met.</cite> iii. 463), which the English version ignores;
while, on the other hand, the prophecy of ll. 730-731:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"I, which whilome was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower of youth, shalbee made flower againe"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">finds no counterpart in Ovid.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxvi" title="xxvi"> </a>

Many of the reflections and entreaties ascribed to
Narcissus in the Latin version are omitted in the English;
neither is there any mention of the beating of the breast
(<cite>Met.</cite> iii. 480-485). The final conversation with Echo is
given thus by Ovid:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eheu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eheu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heu frustra dilecte puer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heu frustra dilecte puer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vale!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vale!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The English writer somewhat amplifies this, Echo
being always a favourite stage-character. The rising up
of Narcissus after death is an English expedient; so is
Echo's return to give a final account of herself, the matter
of which is suggested, as has been said, by <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 393-401.</p>

<p>So much for the classical basis of the play; it remains
to notice briefly the points in which it resembles an
English comedy, or shows traces of the influence of other
English writers. Most remarkable in the latter connection
is the frequent coincidence of expressions between
the <cite>Narcissus</cite> and Shakspere's <cite>Henry IV.</cite> (Part 1.).
Amongst these are the following:</p>

<table summary="expressions of Shakspere">

<p>As <cite>Henry IV.</cite> was entered at Stationers' Hall February
25th, 1597, and the first quarto appeared in 1598,
it is quite possible that these may be direct borrowings
on the part of the writer of the <cite>Narcissus</cite>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxvii" title="xxvii"> </a>

A common trick of English burlesque at this time
(cf. <cite>Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>, v. 1, 337, etc.) was the
inversion of epithets, producing nonsensical combinations;
an expedient which, if we condemn it as poor wit, we
must at least allow to fall under the definition of humour
as "the unexpected." A good example of this occurs
in ll. 360, 361:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So cruell as the huge camelion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet so changing as small elephant."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">And another in ll. 677, 678:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But oh, remaine, and let thy christall lippe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more of this same cherrye water sippe."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sarcastic allusions are also not wanting; see, for instance,
the cheerful inducement held out to Narcissus:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As true as Helen was to Menela,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So true to you will bee thy Florida."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">And cf. the notes on ll. 337, 342.</p>

<p>There are several facetious mistakes in the forms of
words, such as <em>spoone</em> for moon (l. 350), <em>Late-mouse</em> for
Latmus (l. 279), and <em>Davis</em> for Davus (l. 400); of which the
first recalls Ancient Pistol's "Cannibals" (2 <cite>Henry IV.</cite>
ii. 4, 180), or the contrary slip in <cite>Every Man in his
Humour</cite>, iii. 4, 53, and the two latter, Bottom's "Shafalus"
and "Procrus," and the blunders of Costard.</p>

<p>The naïve devices by which the players seem to have
made up for some paucity of accoutrements and stage
appliances, and their direct appeals to the intelligence of
the audience to excuse all defects, are highly edifying.
There is, as I have before remarked, no indication of any
scenery; and the only characters whom we know to have
worn a special dress are Tiresias and Liriope. The
prophets of classical history were often converted into
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxviii" title="xxviii"> </a>bishops by English writers; so, for example, Helenus,
son of Priam, in the fourteenth century alliterative <cite>Gest
Hystoriale of Troy</cite>. This is why Tiresias wears a
bishop's rochet. It is unfortunate that the collection of
robes now in the possession of St. John's College does
not include a garment of this description.</p>

<p>Liriope has a symbolical costume, which she very
carefully interprets to Narcissus:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And I thy mother nimphe, as may bee seene<br /></span>

<p>Cephisus is content to carry the emblems of his origin,
which he emphasizes at the same time by representative
action:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy father I, Cephisus, that brave river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is all water, doe like water shiver.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As any man of iudgment may descrye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By face, hands washt, and bowle, thy father I."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the same way Narcissus, rising up after his supposed
death, bears a daffodil as a sign of his metamorphosis,
addressing the audience after a manner more
brusque than polite:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If you take mee for Narcissus y'are very sillye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I desire you to take mee for a daffa downe dillye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so I rose, and so I am in trothe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As may appeare by the flower in my mouthe."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Echo gives her reasons somewhat confidentially:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But ho, the hobby horse, youle think't absurde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should of my selfe once speake a woord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true; but lett your wisdomes tell me than,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How'de you know Eccho from another man?"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="noi"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxix" title="xxix"> </a>
And at the conclusion of the play she kindly directs the
imagination of the spectators into the right channel:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now auditors of intelligence quicke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray you suppose that Eccho is sicke"&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">and craves their applause by a skilful ruse.</p>

<p>Tiresias makes his exit at an early stage in the play,
addressing congratulations to himself:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Goe, thou hast done, Tyresias; bidd adieu;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy part is well plaid and thy wordes are true."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As a last instance of this naïve custom, Florida's words
at the end of the short part assigned to herself and Clois
may be cited:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Looke you for maids no more, our parte is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wee come but to be scornd, and so are gone."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Both the songs contained in the play have a considerable
amount of vivacity and vigour, though they fall
short of actual lyrical beauty. The first and longer of
the two is a drinking-song with a refrain of eight lines,
written in a lively and irregular, but not ill-handled metre;
the second, a hunting-song of five stanzas, with the chorus
"Yolp" in imitation of the cry of the dogs. Besides
these, which may very possibly have been in existence
before the play was written, the effusion of Dorastus on
meeting Narcissus ("Cracke eye strings cracke," l. 305)
is lyrical in character.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, it will be seen that the comedy of
<cite>Narcissus</cite> is rather interesting for its quaintness, its
humour, and its apparent borrowings from, and undoubted
resemblances to, Shakspere, than for any intrinsic
literary value. In spite of this, I cannot but hope that
those who now study it for the first time, though they<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxx" title="xxx"> </a>
may have "seene a farre better play at the theater," will
not find reason to condemn it as wholly dull and unprofitable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.</span></h3>

<p>It only remains to say a few words with regard to the
four pieces which I have included in the present volume.</p>

<p>These occur in the same MS. as the <cite>Narcissus</cite>, and
taken with it appear to form a united group, by virtue
of their common connection with S. John's College.
It is true that the Porter who acts so prominent a part
in the admission of the supposed players reveals to us
only his Christian name, Frances (see last line of Epilogue),
but it is hardly possible to doubt his identity with
the Francke (or Francis) Clarke, the porter of S. John's,
to whom the remarkable productions above-mentioned
are attributed. After several vain attempts to discover
the record of this man's tenure of office, I have chanced
upon his name in Mr. A. Clark's <cite>Register of the University
of Oxford</cite>, vol. ii. (1571-1622), pt. 1, p. 398, where it occurs
in the list of "personæ privilegiatæ," a term including, in
its widest sense, all persons who enjoyed the immunities
conferred by charter on the corporation of the University,
but technically used to describe certain classes to
whom these immunities were granted by special favour;
as, for example, the college servants, of whom the
manciple, cook, and porter or janitor, were amongst the
chief.</p>

<p>The entry is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"8 May 1601, S. Jo., Clark, Francis; Worc., pleb. f., 24; 'janitor.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>From this we gather that Francis Clark had not been<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxxi" title="xxxi"> </a>
long appointed to his office; that he was twenty-four
years of age, a Worcestershire man, and of humble birth.</p>

<p>Judging by the internal evidence of the MS. now
under consideration, we may very naturally suppose that
the porter, a worthy possessed of a shrewd wit and somewhat
combative temperament, enjoyed high favour
amongst the undergraduates, though often in disgrace
with their superiors; and that for his benefit (in the case
of the first and fourth pieces), and for their own (in the
case of the third), the wags of the college composed
certain apologies, which Francis Clarke was clever
enough to commit to memory, and confident enough to
pronounce before the Head in the character of a privileged
humourist. The last of the pieces seems to have
been written down and delivered as a letter; and some
or all may be the products of the same pen as wrote the
<cite>Narcissus</cite>. That they were not written by the porter
himself is evident; for over and above the mere improbability
that a college servant would be capable of such
frequent reference to Lilly, we have the testimony of the
headings, two of which bear mention of "a speech <em>made
for</em> the foresaid porter," and "a letter <em>composed for</em>
Francke Clarke." It is very possible that the porter's
part in the <cite>Narcissus</cite> may have been specially designed
for, and entrusted to, the worthy Francis.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of these four pieces, the apology addressed to "Master
President, that had sconc't him 10 groates for lettinge
the fidlers into the hall at Christmas," occurs next to the
play in the MS., and was probably the result of some
mock trial and sentence forming a part of the Christmas
festivities. If we could suppose the "fidlers" to have been
the same as the players, a still closer connection would be<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxxii" title="xxxii"> </a>
established between this speech and the comedy; but
there is no mention of any dramatic entertainment in the
circumstantial account of their entrance and exit given by
the porter.</p>

<p>The other pieces have no apparent connection with
Christmas time, and the last, being addressed to Laud
during the year of his proctorship, fixes its own date as
1603-4. The speech <em>To the Ladie Keneda</em> is the most
puzzling of the group, inasmuch as it bears no reference to
collegiate life, and deals with a subject of some obscurity.
<em>Kennedy</em> was the family name of the earls of Cassilis;
and the fifth earl, then living, had married in 1597 Jean,
daughter of James, fourth Lord Fleming, and widow of
Lord Chancellor Maitland. But whether she is the
"Ladie Keneda" to whom Francis Clarke pleads on
behalf of her cook Piers, it is impossible to say. Neither
have I found out anything concerning the annual holiday
for cooks, to which allusion seems to be made. Here,
however, as in the other speeches, a wide margin must be
allowed for euphuism, and bare facts are difficult to
deduce.</p>

<p>I have refrained from supplying references to the
numerous classical quotations with which the speeches
are embellished, for the simple reason that a contemporary
edition of Lilly's Grammar will be found to include
them all. Doubtless the youthful composers derived a
special delight from the process of making "Lilly leape out
of his skinne," with a "muster of sentences" of which the
porter's supposed use and interpretation is, if not always
scholarly, at least decidedly ingenious.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<blockquote><p class="hang"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
<span class="sidenote">F. 84<sup>r</sup> rev.</span><em>A speech made for the foresaid porter, who pronounc't it
in the hall before most of the house and Master Præsident,
that had sconc't him 10 groates for lettinge the
fidlers into the hall at Christmas.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Ille ego qui quondam, I am hee that in ould season
have made Lilly leape out of his skinne, &amp; with a
muster of sentences out of his syntaxis have besieged the
eares of the audience in the behalfe of the wretched.
But alas!&mdash;Mihi isthic nec seritur nec metitur; it is to
mee neither a sorrye turne nor a merrye turne. I have
sifted out for other mens sakes the flower of my fancye,
that I have left nothing but the branne in my braine.
And yet who is there amongst them that in the depth of
my distresse will speake for the poore porter, who meltes <span class="linenum">10</span>
the muses into mourninge or turnes Parnassus into
plaintes, Hellicon into heavines, Apollo into an apollogie,
for my sake? My learninge goeth not beyond Lillye,
nor my reading beyond my rules, yet have I for them so
canvast their concavitye that I have opened their entraills,
so dived into the depth of them that I have manifested their
marrowe, soe pried into their profunditye that I have plac't
the verye pith of them before you. And, alas that I should
<span class="sidenote">F. 83<sup>v</sup> rev.</span> now speake for my selfe, what remaines for mee but the
rinde &amp; the barke, when I have given the roote &amp; <span class="linenum">20</span>
the bodye to others? What remaines for mee but the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
shell, when I have given others the substaunce, what
remaines for mee but the curdes, when I have given
others the creame? Yea, what is left for mee but the
paringes, when I have given others the peares? But I
therin made knowen my valour, for you knowe, Aliorum
vitia cernere oblivisci suorum, to supplye other mens
wants &amp; to forgett his owne, proprium est stultitiæ, is
the parte of a stoute man; since then I must speake for
my selfe, Stat mihi casus renovare omnes; you shall <span class="linenum">30</span>
heare the whole cause, case, and the course of it.</p>

<p>Sub nocte silenti, (i) in nocte vel paulo ante noctem,
cum spectatur in ignibus aurum; when you might have
seene gold in the fier, the fier shin'de so like gold, Ecce
per opaca locorum, came the fidlers creeping alonge,
densa subter testudine casus, their instruments vnder
their arms, in their cases, &amp; at lenghe, Itum est in
viscera terræ, broke open into the harte of the hall;
neither when they were there could they bee content to <span class="sidenote">F. 83<sup>r</sup> rev.</span>warme their fingers by the fier and bee gone, though I <span class="linenum">40</span>
would have persuaded them thereto, but Iuvat vsque
morari et conferre gradum; they would needes staye &amp;
the youth daunce; but oh to see, woe to see, that pleasure
is but a pinch and felicitye but a phillippe; when as
Juvat ire per altum, some were cutting capers aloft in
the ayre, canit similiter huic, and they likewise with
their minstrelsey fitting it to their footing, all on a suddaine,
Subito I may say to them, but Repente to mee,
their sporte was spoild, their musicke marrd, their dauncinge
dasht with a vox hominem sonat, with a voyce, <span class="linenum">50</span>
with an awefull voice, Hæccine fieri flagitia; ar these
the fruites of the fires; statur a me, (i) sto, statur ab illis,
(i) stant; they that even now scrap't so fast with their<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>
stickes fell now to scraping faster with their leggs; their
fum fum was turn'd to mum mum, and their pleasaunt
melodye to most pittifull making of faces; but when they
look't that their fiddles should have flyen about their
eares, their calveskin cases about their calveshead pates,
as the sunne shines brightest through a shower, so did
softnes in the midst of severitye: <span class="sidenote">F. 82<sup>v</sup> rev.</span>there was noe more <span class="linenum">60</span>
said to them but, Teque his ait eripe flammis; they were
best, since they had made many mens heeles warme with
shakinge, to coole their owne by quaking without doore.
But the more mercy was shewed before, the lesse was
left for mee. Had I beene dealt with soe mercifullye, I
had not neede to have come with this exclamation, or
had it beene but gratia ab officio, but a groat out of mine
office, I should not have stonied the stones nor rented
the rockes with my dolorous outcryes.</p>

<p>But when it shall come to denarii dicti quod denos,
<span class="linenum">70</span>
when tenn groats shall make a muster togeather and sitte
heavy on my head, actum est ilicet, the porter periit. O
weathercoke of wretchednes that I am, seated on the
may-pole of misfortune; whither shall I turne, or to
whome shall I looke for releife? Shall I speake to my
minstrells for my money? Why, they have allready
forsaken mee, to the verifieng of the ould proverbe;
Quantum quisque sua nummorum servat in arc&#257;, tantum
habet et fidei; as long as a man hath money in his purse,
so long hee shall have the fidlers. What is to bee looked
<span class="linenum">80</span>
for of them that will doe nothing without pay, and hard-mony
for their harmonye? Shall I speake to my frends?
Why: nullus ad amissas ibit amicus opes. <span class="sidenote">F. 43<span class="err" title="original: r."><sup>r</sup></span> rev.</span>Oh, then, lett
mee runne to the speare of Achilles (recorded by auncient
philosophers) which first hurt mee and last can heale
mee: lett my penitencye find pittye, and my confession<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
move compassion; if you will live according to rule, ever
after penitet, tædet, lett miseret, miserescit succeede.</p>

<p>That they came in, it was a fault of oversight in not
overseeing my office: if any should slinke by Cerberus <span class="linenum">90</span>
out of hell, it weare a thing to bee wondred at, &amp; yet
wee see there doth, ther are so many spirritts walking.
If any should steale by Janus into heaven, it weare much
woorthy of marvaile, and yet wee see there doth, there
are soe many of Jupiters lemmans: if anye should skippe
in or out by mee it is not to bee admired: for why?
Cerberus the porter of hell hath 3 heads, Janus hath two,
&amp; I your poore colledg porter have but one. That
they weare not putt out of the colledge when they weare
in, it was a fault; but a fault of curtesie; for who could
<span class="linenum">100</span>
find in his hart, when hee seeth a man accompanied with
musicke, musis comitantibus, to bidd him, Ibis Homere
foras, gett you home for an asse?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">F. 42<sup>v</sup> rev.</span>But though my breast (I must confesse) weare then
somewhat moved with their melodye, yet heerafter my
breast shall bee marble when they warble: Nemo sibi
Mimos accipere debet favori, I will never lett in minstrells
againe vpon favour; for your selves I can say no more
but profit; &amp; when (after this Christmas cheere is
ended) you fall againe to your studdies, I could wish that <span class="linenum">110</span>
Hippocrene may bee Hippocrise, the muses Muskadine,
&amp; the Pierides pies every day for your sakes; and as

will give you decies decem mille gratiarum. Dixi.</p>

porch before so great an house, and have called their show

reprehension; therfore I will make hast away, onely asking

S. John's and his wife. The office was held at this time by
Ralph Hutchinson, who had been elected to it in 1590, after
holding for some years the college living of Charlbury, Oxon.
Little seems to be known of Mrs. Hutchinson beyond the fact
that after her husband's death in 1606 she placed his effigy in
the college chapel.</p>

<p>Line 39. <em>Rebateth.</em>&mdash;To rebate, to blunt or disedge; see
<em>Measure for Measure</em>, i. 4, 60&mdash;"Doth rebate and blunt his
natural edge."</p>

<p>Line 55. <em>Quaffe.</em>&mdash;The substantival use of this word is not
uncommon in contemporary writings. Cf., in 1579, L. Tomson,
Calvin's <cite>Sermons on Timothy, &amp;c.,</cite> p. 512, col. 2: "Now they
thinke that a sermon costeth no more then a quaffe wil them."</p>

<p>Line 78. <em>Ladds of mettall.</em>&mdash;Cf. 1 <cite>Henry IV.</cite> ii. 4, 13.</p>

<p>Line 80.<em> No vertue extant.</em>&mdash;Cf. 1 <cite>Henry IV.</cite> ii. 4, 132, where
virtue = bravery, physical courage. The porter's use of the
phrase sounds like a quotation.</p>

<p>Line 97. <em>A the stampe.</em>&mdash;Halliwell gives "Stamp, a tune,"
and quotes from MS. Fairfax, 16, "Songes, stampes, and eke
daunces." Cf. also <cite>Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>, iii. 2, 25.</p>

<p>Line 98. <em>Windsuckers.</em>&mdash;This old name for the kestrel, or
wind-hover, is of tolerably frequent occurrence. It is used
metaphorically of a person ready to pounce on anything. "There
is a certain envious windsucker that hovers up and down"
(Chapman).</p>

<p>Line 101. <em>I pre, sequor.</em>&mdash;Literally, "Go before, I follow." The
porter supplies a free translation in the words "one of your<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
consorte." Cf. the use of the phrase "to be hail-fellow-well-met
with anyone."</p>

<p>Line 109. <em>Condolent</em> here means <em>expressing sorrow</em>. For this
sense see Wood, Ath. Oxon. (R)&mdash;"His vein for ditty and
amorous ode was deemed most lofty, condolent, and passionate."</p>

<p>Line 110. <em>Suffocat.</em>&mdash;The porter's substitute for <em>sufficit</em>;
though, strictly speaking, the <em>o</em> should be long.</p>

<p>Line 111. <em>I tickle them for a good voice.</em>&mdash;Besides the ordinary
metaphorical meaning of to flatter, <em>tickle</em> sometimes = to serve
one right, to make one pay for a thing. For this sense see
1 <cite>Henry IV.</cite> ii. 4, 489, "I'll tickle ye for a young prince, i'
faith;" and cf. <em>Ibid.</em> ii. 1, 66. Probably the expression has a
similar force here.</p>

<p>Line 114. <em>Butterd beare.</em>&mdash;Ale boiled with lump-sugar, butter,
and spice.</p>

<p>Line 122. <em>Act in conye.</em>&mdash;The adjective <em>incony</em>, with the apparent
sense of fine, delicate, is used twice by Costard in <em>Love's
Labour's Lost</em> (iii. 136, iv. 1, 144) and also in Marlowe's <em>Jew of
Malta</em>, iv. 5&mdash;"While I in thy incony lap do tumble." Other
examples are rare, and I have not found any instance of an
adverbial use. A second, though much less probable interpretation
of the passage is suggested by the frequent use of <em>cony</em> as
a term of endearment to a woman (cf. Skelton's <em>Eleanor Rummyng</em>,
225&mdash;"He called me his whytyng, his nobbes, and his
conny"). If, however, "act in conye" were equivalent to "act
as woman," <em>i.e.</em> take a female part, examples of analogous constructions
should be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Line 129. <em>Lovely.</em>&mdash;Here used in the sense of loving, tender.
Cf. <em>Taming of the Shrew</em>, iii. 2, 125&mdash;"And seal the title with a
lovely kiss."</p>

<p>Line 156. <em>All and some.</em>&mdash;An expression meaning everyone,

<p class="noi">To <em>thrum</em> = to beat in the Suffolk dialect.</p>

<p>Line 167. <em>Shrimpe.</em>&mdash;This use of the word in the sense of
child, offspring (or possibly as a term of endearment, "little
one") is not common. It was generally employed contemptuously,
and meant a dwarfish or stunted creature, as in <em>1 Henry VI.</em>

<p>Line 195. <em>Seven yeares I was a woman.</em>&mdash;The blindness of
Tiresias is most frequently ascribed, either to his having, when
a child, revealed the secrets of the gods, or to his having gazed
upon Athenè bathing, on which occasion the goddess is said to
have deprived him of sight. Another tradition, however (adhered
to by Ovid, <cite>Met.</cite> iii. 516, etc.), relates that Tiresias beheld two
serpents together; he struck at them, and, happening to kill the
female, was himself changed into a woman. Seven years later
he again encountered two serpents, but now killed the male, and
resumed the shape of man. Zeus and Hera, disputing over the
relative happiness of man and woman, referred the matter to
Tiresias, as having a practical knowledge of both conditions.
He favoured Zeus's assertion that a woman possessed the more
enjoyments; whereupon Hera, indignant, blinded him, while
Zeus bestowed on him, in compensation, the power of prophecy.</p>

<p>Line 197. <em>Fold.</em>&mdash;The omission of a prefix to suit the exigencies
of metre, common enough in verbs such as defend, defile, becomes
remarkable when the force of the prefix itself is such as to change
entirely the meaning of the verb. Examples of omission in such
cases are comparatively rare, but they are not confined to our
own language. See Vergil, <em>Aen.</em> i. 262&mdash;</p>

<p>Line 227. <em>Curromanstike</em>, chiromantic, <em>i.e.</em> pertaining to chiromancy;
the rhyme being probably responsible for the use of the
adjective rather than the noun.</p>

<p>Line 229. <em>The table</em>, etc.&mdash;"The table-line, or line of fortune,
begins under the mount of Mercury, and ends near the index
and middle finger.... When lines come from the mount of
Venus, and cut the line of life, it denotes the party unfortunate
in love and business, and threatens him with some suddain death"
(<em>The True Fortune-teller, or Guide to Knowledge</em>, 1686).</p>

<p>Line 236. <em>Sheppbiter.</em>&mdash;A malicious, surly fellow; according to

"The niggardly, rascally sheep-biter."</p>

<p>Line 246. <em>What.</em>&mdash;MS. has the abbreviation w<sup>th</sup>, usually
denoting <em>with</em>, but evidently substituted here, by a copyist's
error, for w<sup>t</sup> = <em>what</em>.</p>

<p>Line 247. <em>They can but bring</em>, etc.&mdash;W. Carew Hazlitt (<em>English
Proverbs</em>, p. 28) quotes from Heywood, 1562&mdash;"A man maie
well bring a horse to the water, but he can not make him drinke
without he will." He also mentions that the proverb is ascribed
(probably falsely) to Queen Elizabeth, in the <em>Philosopher's
Banquet</em> (1614).</p>

<p>Line 261. <em>I</em> = ay.&mdash;Both spellings occur in the MS. For the

Line 279.&mdash;<em>Late-mouse.</em>&mdash;A facetious spelling of Latmus, the

<p>Line 281. <em>Shift</em> originally meant simply change, substitution
of one thing for another. Cf. <cite>Timon of Athens</cite>, i. 1, 84&mdash;"Fortune,
in her shift and change of mood." Wotton writes&mdash;"My
going to Oxford was not merely for shift of air." From
this arose the later sense of a change of clothing, in which the
word is here used; and which has now become further limited,
<em>shift</em> amongst the lower classes being equivalent to an under-garment.</p>

<p>Line 282. <em>Cantle.</em>&mdash;A corner, angle, small point. Cf. 1 <cite>Henry IV.</cite>
iii. 1, 100; <cite>Antony and Cleopatra</cite>, iii. 10, 6. See also under <em>cantle</em>
in N. E. D.</p>

<p>Line 283. <em>Portmantle.</em>&mdash;The older and commoner form of
<em>portmanteau</em>, occurring, for example, in Howell's <em>Familiar
Letters</em> (1623). Early instances of <em>portmanteau</em> are, however,
to be found.</p>

<p>Line 296. <em>Ile bee a diar,</em> etc.&mdash;The joke is on the double meaning
of <em>diar</em>; there seems to be no special significance in the
choice of the colour orange-tawny.</p>

<p>Line 300. <em>Codshead</em> = stupid-head, foolish fellow. Cf. in 1607,
Drewill's <em>Arraignm</em>. in Harl. Misc. (Malh.) iii. 56:&mdash;"Lloyd
(threatning he) woulde trye acquaintance with the other codsheade."
Also, in 1594, Carew Huarte's <em>Exam. Wits</em>, i. (1596),
2:&mdash;"His (Cicero's) sonne ... prooued but a cods-head."</p>

<p>The line was a frequent subject of ridicule amongst contemporary
writers; cf. <em>Every Man in his Humour</em>, i. 5, 58, etc.</p>

<p>Line 316. <em>Fennell.</em>&mdash;F&oelig;niculum vulgare, considered as an inflammatory
herb, and used as an emblem of flattery. Cf.
<em>Hamlet</em>, iv. 5, 180.</p>

<p>Line 320. <em>Thou.</em>&mdash;MS. has <em>though</em>.</p>

<p>Line 327. <em>Weasand.</em>&mdash;This word is generally used as a noun,
and itself means wind-pipe. Cf. <cite>Tempest</cite>, iii. 2, 99.</p>

<p>Line 328. <em>Thy face more faire, etc.</em>&mdash;According to some legends,
Gorgon or Medusa was a beautiful maiden before Athenè, in<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
anger, changed her hair into serpents, thereby rendering her so
hideous that all who saw her became petrified. Possibly, however,
the allusion here is merely facetious.</p>

<p>Line 329. <em>Dishevells.</em>&mdash;Spreads in disorder (an intransitive use).
"Their hair, curling, dishevels about their shoulders." (Sir T.
Herbert.)</p>

<p>Line 330. <em>Queene of devills.</em>&mdash;Probably Persephone, the wife
of Pluto, who ruled amongst the shades of the departed.</p>

<p>Line 332. <em>Mavors</em> or <em>Mavers</em> is the form from which <em>Mars</em> is
contracted.</p>

<p>Line 337. <em>Silenus for streight backe.</em>&mdash;Silenus is usually depicted
as a fat, jovial old man, intoxicated and requiring support.
The comparison is of course ironical.</p>

<p>Line 339. <em>Rine</em> = rind or bark. The O. E. form was rinde;
but for a similar omission of <em>d</em> in the literary language cf. <em>lime</em>
(O. E. linde) and <em>lawn</em> (M. E. launde).</p>

<p>Line 342. <em>Whose nose, etc.</em>&mdash;Cf. <em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, v.
338. A similar jest occurs in Peele's "Old Wives' Tale":
"Her corall lippes, her crimson chinne."</p>

<p>Line 345. <em>Thy.</em>&mdash;MS. has <em>they</em>.</p>

<p>Line 360. <em>Cruell</em>, <em>huge</em>, are the epithets properly belonging to
<em>elephant</em>; <em>changing</em>, <em>small</em>, to <em>chameleon</em>. See Introduction.</p>

<p>Line 396. <em>Ile beare thee light.</em>&mdash;If this expression be an idiom,
I can find no other instance of it; cf., however, the analogous
phrase "to bear hard," <em>i.e.</em> to take ill (<cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, ii. 1, 215;
1 <cite>Henry IV.</cite> i. 3, 270). The punning character of the passage
makes it difficult to determine what exact meaning Florida
wishes to convey. A not improbable sense would be obtained
by supplying a comma after <em>thee</em>, and thus turning <em>light</em> into a
nominative of address.</p>

<p>Line 440. <em>Scummer.</em>&mdash;The meanings of this word appear to be
either various or obscure. Halliwell gives "<em>Scummer</em>, wonder;
Somerset." In Elworthy's <cite>West Somersetshire Wordbook</cite> the
definitions stand thus: (1) row, disturbance; (2) confusion,
upset; (3) mess, dirty muddle. Wright, in his <cite>Provincial Dictionary</cite>,
gives the meaning as ordure, without referring the word
to any special locality. Obviously, this <em>scummer</em> is not to be
confounded with M. E. <em>scumer</em>, a rover or pirate.</p>

<p>Line 441. <em>Surquedry</em>, presumption, arrogance, conceit. Chaucer
has&mdash;"Presumpcion is he whan a man taketh an emprise that
him ought not to do, or ellis he may it not do &amp; that is called
surquidrie" (<em>Parson's Tale</em>, Corpus MS.).</p>

<p>Line 441. <em>Shooing-horne.</em>&mdash;Metaphorically, anything which
helps to draw something else on: a tool. Cf. <cite>Troilus and
Cressida</cite>, v. 1, 61: "A thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging
at his brother's leg." The expression "shoeing horn of surquedry"
is thus equivalent to "chosen implement of personified
arrogance."</p>

<p>Line 442. <em>Casting topp</em>, a peg-top. See W. Coles (1657),
<cite>Adam in Eden</cite>, 169&mdash;"The fruit is in forme like a casting-top."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>

Line 443. <em>Stopple.</em>&mdash;The older form of stopper. Cotgrave has&mdash;"Tampon,
a bung or stopple."</p>

<p>Line 446. <em>Vpp leave.</em>&mdash;So MS. for <em>vpp heave</em>, possibly by confusion
with <em>vpp lift</em>.</p>

<p>Line 453. <em>Corneagle.</em>&mdash;I can find no instances whatever of
this very puzzling word; neither does it seem to be closely analogous
to any known form. Can <em>corneagle</em> be a corrupt spelling
of <em>co-niggle</em>, to niggle both (our hearts) together? <em>Niggle</em> was
used formerly for deceive, steal (still in the dialects), make
sport of, mock; but is not, to my knowledge, compounded elsewhere
with this prefix. Or is "harts corneagle" a substitution
for "harts' core niggle"? (Heart's core occurs in <cite>Hamlet</cite>.)
Both explanations have been suggested to me only as a last
resource, and are too far-fetched to be at all convincing. Moreover,
the context seems to require the sense of pursue, persecute,
rather than of deceive.</p>

<p>Line 464. <cite>Tales of tubbes.</cite>&mdash;A characteristic rendering into
Elizabethan English of Ovid's "Illa Deam longo prudens sermone
tenebat." The earliest instances of the expression "tales
of tubs" seem to occur about the middle of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p><cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, series v. vol. xi. p. 505, quotes amongst
"curious phrases in 1580"&mdash;"To heare some Gospel of a
distaffe and tale of a tubbe" (<cite>Beehive of the Romish Church</cite>,
fo. 275<sup>b</sup>). See also Holland's "Plutarch," p. 644, and (for
further references) Dodsley-Hazlitt's <cite>Old Plays</cite>, ii. 335.</p>

<p>Line 475. <em>Quatte.</em>&mdash;A corruption of <em>squat</em>, sometimes used
substantively for the sitting of a hare:</p>
<div class="poetry">

<p class="right">(<cite>White Devil</cite>, 4to, H.)</p>

<p class="noi">That the word in this sense was not general may be gathered
from the fact that George Turberville, in his full description of
the various methods of hunting the hare (<cite>Noble Art of Venerie</cite>,
1575), makes no use of it, but speaks constantly of the hare's
form. <em>Quat</em> for <em>squat</em> (non-substantival) is still frequent in some
of the dialects, and is the word specially used of a hare or other
game when flattening itself on the earth to escape observation.
In West Somersetshire it is used in connection with the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
verb to go&mdash;"The hare went quat" (Elworthy). This is the
modern use most nearly approximating to that of the present
passage.</p>

<p>Line 476. <em>Watt</em>, the old name for a hare; hence metaphorically
used of a wily, cautious person (Halliwell).</p>

<p>Line 478. <em>Hollowe in the hind doggs.</em>&mdash;Turberville, describing
the hunting of hares, writes,&mdash;"One of the huntesmen shall take
charge to rate &amp; beate on <em>such doggs as bide plodding behinde</em>;
and the other shall make them seeke and cast about."</p>

Humour</cite>, i. 1, 56.</p>

<p>Line 537. <em>Patch.</em>&mdash;A term of contempt, generally supposed to
have been first applied to professional fools, by reason of their

quotation from 1 <cite>Henry IV.</cite> ii. 1, 53:</p>

<p class="noi">I am told that the colloquial use of <em>kee</em>, or <em>quy</em>, for <em>quoth</em>, is
frequent in certain parts of Scotland; but I can find no literary
example of the form, and it is hard to account for its presence
in this passage. The scribal substitution of <em>quy</em> for the abbreviated
<em>quoth</em> might easily occur, the thorn-letter being erroneously
transcribed by <em>y</em>, as in <em>the</em>; but this cannot have given
rise to any M. E. phonetic change such as the spelling <em>kee</em> certainly
implies.</p>

<p>Line 686. <em>Dicker.</em>&mdash;Ten of any commodity, as ten hides of
leather, ten bars of iron, etc. This word comes from the late
Latin <em>dicra</em> (<em>dicora, decora, dacra, dacrum</em>), classical Latin <em>decuria</em>,
meaning ten hides, occasionally ten of other things. "Also that
no maner foreyn sille no lether in the seid cite, but it be in the
yelde halle of the same, paying for the custom of every <em>dyker</em> i.d."
(<em>English Guilds</em>, ed. by Toulmin Smith, p. 384). For the wide
use of the word in Western and Northern Europe, cf. O. Norse
<em>dekr</em>, ten hides, M. H. G. <em>decker</em>, ten of anything, especially hides.
Modern German <em>decker</em> = ten hides.</p>

<p>Line 735. <em>Randome.</em>&mdash;The verb random, to stray wildly, is
more frequently found with the original spelling <em>randon</em> (French
<em>randoner</em>, to run rapidly), which became altered, possibly by
analogy with <em>whilom</em> and <em>seldom</em>, possibly by a process of
change similar to that which converted <em>ranson</em> to <em>ransom</em>. Sackville
writes:&mdash;"Shall leave them free to randon of their will."</p>

<h2>NOTES TO THE APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Line 32. (<em>i</em>) is here equivalent to <em>id est</em>. Lilly gives the
examples of lines 52, 53 (in which the same abbreviation here
occurs) with the words written in full.</p>

<p>Line 48. <em>Repente.</em>&mdash;A play on the meaning of the English and
the form of the Latin word <em>repente</em> is clearly intended.</p>

<p>Line 70. "Denarii dicti, quod denos æris valebant; quinarii,
quod quinos" (Varro).</p>

<p>Line 93. <em>Janus</em> is frequently, though not invariably, represented
in mythology as guardian of the entrance to heaven; in which
capacity he holds in his right hand a staff, and in his left a key,
symbolical of his office (Ovid, <em>Fast.</em> i. 125). The names of
Jupiter and Janus were usually coupled in prayer, as the
divinities whose aid it was necessary to invoke at the beginning
of any undertaking. Jupiter gave by augury the requisite sanction;
but it was the part of Janus to confer a blessing at the
outset.</p>

<p>Line 111. <em>Hippocrise.</em>&mdash;A beverage composed of wine, with
spices and sugar, strained through a cloth; said to have been
named from Hippocrates' sleeve, the term given by apothecaries
to a strainer (Halliwell).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>

Line 111. <em>Muskadine.</em>&mdash;A well-known rich wine.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And I will have also wyne de Ryne<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Muscadell, terantyne, and bastard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Ypocras and Pyment comyng afterwarde."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="right">(<em>MS. Rawl.</em> C. 86.)</p>

<p class="noi">Though <em>muscadell</em> is the usual form (for instances see Furnivall,
<em>The Babees Book</em>, p. 205), the spelling <em>muscadine</em> occurs in
Beaumont and Fletcher's <em>Loyal Subject</em>, iii. 4.</p>

<p>Line 112. <em>The Pierides pies.</em>&mdash;The reference is not to the
Muses themselves (sometimes called Pierides from Pieria, near
Olympus), but to the nine daughters of Pierus, who for attempting
to rival the Muses were changed into birds of the magpie kind.
For a full account of the transformation see Ovid, <cite>Met.</cite> v. 670,
etc. There is a play here on the double meaning of <em>pie</em>, namely
a bird (Latin pica), and an article of food.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Line 23.&mdash;<em>Keele</em>, to cool, from O. E. cêlan, M. E. kelen. See
<em>Love's Labour's Lost</em>, v. 2, 930&mdash;"While greasy Joan doth keel
the pot." Usually, however, the verb bore the derived sense of
"to keep from boiling over by stirring round." <em>A Tour to the
Caves</em>, 1781, gives&mdash;"<em>Keel</em>, to keep the pot from boiling over."
This is evidently the meaning which should be adopted here.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Line 13. <em>It is bootles</em>, etc.&mdash;Puns on the different meanings of
the word <em>boot</em> are very common in Elizabethan writers, and the
relevant use of the one frequently entails the irrelevant introduction
of the other. See, for example, <cite>Two Gentlemen of
Verona</cite>, i. 1, 27, etc.:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<em>Pro.</em> Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><em>Val.</em> No, I will not, for it boots thee not."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And <em>Every Man in his Humour</em>, i. 3, 30, etc.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"<em>Brai.</em> Why, you may ha' my master's gelding, to save your longing, sir.</p>

<p><em>Step.</em> But I ha' no boots, that's the spite on't.</p>

<p><em>Brai.</em> Why, a fine wisp of hay roll'd hard, Master Stephen.</p>

<p><em>Step.</em> No, faith, it's no boot to follow him now."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noi"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
"Give me not the boots" = "do not make a laughing-stock
of me."</p>

<p>Line 48. <em>Ioynd stooles.</em>&mdash;The word joint-stool, meaning a seat
made with joints, a folding-chair, is sometimes spelt <em>join'd stool</em>
in old editions of Shakespeare. The porter's use of this form is
probably intended to convey a jest; <em>ioynd stooles</em> is here equivalent
to stooles joined to one another, and the term is used as a facetious
synonym for <em>bench</em>.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Line 6. <em>Oulde.</em>&mdash;So MS., possibly for <em>whole</em>.</p>

<p>Line 19. <em>A man &amp; noe beast.</em>&mdash;An inversion, probably intentional.</p>

<p>Line 22. <em>Condole my tragedies.</em>&mdash;<em>Condole</em> is here used in the
now obsolete transitive sense, and is equivalent to bewail, grieve
over, lament. See (in 1607) Hieron, <em>Works</em>, i. 179&mdash;"How
tender-hearted the Lord is, and how he doth ... condole our
miseries." Cf. also Pistol's use of the verb, <cite>Henry V.</cite> ii. 1, 133.</p>

<p>Line 24. <em>Craues.</em>&mdash;The substantive crave, = craving, is not in
general use, but appears to be considered rather as a new formation
than as an obsolete word. Thus the earliest of the three
examples given in the N. E. D. dates from 1830&mdash;"His crave
and his vanity so far deluded him" (<cite>Fraser's Magazine</cite>, i. 134).
This is a clear instance of a previous use.</p>

<p>The sentence as it stands presents some difficulty, inasmuch
as the porter has made in the course of his speech only two
distinct petitions, namely that he may be forgiven "all delictes
and crimes" (l. 10), and that his black staff may be restored to him
(l. 18). Perhaps the delicate hint concerning "my ladye pecunia,"
coupled with the appeal to "the profunditye or abisse" of the
President's liberality, is to be considered as constituting a third.</p>
